Most people are interested in our "Triangle WiFi" and gave us a very helpful feed back: the UI looks too simple. so since last night, we started to design the new UI. We found a bug also, KJ (my best partner) spent the whole day to solve the logic problem of program and try to fix it, the good news is he fixed the bug.
