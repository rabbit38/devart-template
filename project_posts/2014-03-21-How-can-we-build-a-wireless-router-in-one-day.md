##The answer is impossible

The first thing after we decide to start this DevArt project is that, we need a router to provide WiFi.

But, any wireless router we can get from the market doesn't meet my second requirement. Because it should be able to allow people to hack.

OpenWRT?

Maybe that's the solution. However I have no idea to play with that toy.

I have the solution of my own: [https://github.com/WifiPi/router](https://github.com/WifiPi/router)

I worked on this project last year.

Basicly I did a lot of search on Google about how to turn a Raspberry Pi board into a wireless router. It's based on Raspbian instead of OpenWRT. Besides, it's the router which I was actually using at home.

After I manage to hack the Raspberry Pi as my router, I did not stop. Since I thought it's quite useful if we gave this raw Linux version router a web interface, I did some extra work.

I named that project **WifiPi**. Also we make it **open source**.
