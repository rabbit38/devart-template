##The answer is impossible

The first thing after we decide to start this DevArt project is that, we need a router to provide WiFi.

But, no wireless router from the market can meet my second requirement: it should be able to allow people to hack.

OpenWRT?

Maybe that's the solution. However I have no idea to play with that toy.

Now I have the solution of my own: [https://github.com/WifiPi/router](https://github.com/WifiPi/router)

![WifiPi](../project_images/wifipi.png?raw=true "WifiPi")

I worked on this project last year.

Basically I did a lot of research on Google about how to turn a Raspberry Pi board into a wireless router. It's based on Raspbian instead of OpenWRT. Besides, it's the router which I do use at home.

After hacking the Raspberry Pi as my router, I did not stop. I gave this raw Linux version router a web interface, since I thought it's quite useful.

I named that project **WifiPi** and made it **open source** also.
