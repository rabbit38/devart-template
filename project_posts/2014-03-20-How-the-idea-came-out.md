It was the Friday night. We were talking about the DevArt projects other people were working on.

Meanwhile I was playing around with the coins on the desktop. Yes, when I was playing with money, this idea came out:

    What happened if we need to insert some coins into a WiFi router, then it allows me to access Internet.

We both think the idea was funny. Soon we realise that what we said just now is not totally a joke. Because we have enough knowledge and technology to implement it.

We decided to start this project at once.
