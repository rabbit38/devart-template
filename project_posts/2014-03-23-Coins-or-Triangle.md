Internet like air, people can't see or smell or hear it. We kept brainstorming our ideas.

Our initial idea is building something like an Arcade game, people insert coins to start using WiFi. When we discussed that, I was playing coins and listening to the metallic sound of coins collision. It reminded us a great SiFi show "Fringe".

There is a part about ring the "William's bell" to summon Bell back through the "soul magnets". Both of us love this part and thought that's a good idea to make people touch, hear and feel Internet.

After discussion, we changed our idea from "insert coins" to "ring the bell". We think it's more meaningful and interactive, that is -- "take action before accessing the WiFi".
